#Publishing your code online

My most popular languages for data analysis are python and R. I like them for different reasons, and while recently I use predominantly ipython with pandas, I still think ease of visualising things in R is next to none.
One extremely useful thing in both languages is the ability to display your code online:

* [ipython notebooks (jupyter)](https://jupyter.org/) for python
* [kinitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) for R

As of recent both of those can be natively displayed in github as well.

##Rendering jupyter directly via Nbviewer

 But what many might not know can be also easily rendered via Nbviewer. How? Details are in [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19744286/hosting-ipython-notebooks-on-github):

 * format is http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/RAW_github_link
 	* where RAW_github_link is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USER_NAME/link2file

For example  <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/DfAC/Coursera_DataAnalysisandInterpretationSpecialization/edit/master/DataVisualisation_week03.ipynb> will render my notebook
