##Making post beautiful

I found [this post with fishes](http://abowman.com/google-modules/fish/#gadgetSWF) and decided to add it to my blog. It seems a bit more complex then expected but search also enabled me to find [this vide post](http://cpsievert.github.io/2013/05/yu-darvishs-deception-factor/) and [talk about it](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23699129/use-animation-in-jekyll-based-github-pages).

And some more [blogs about it](http://blog.nheer.io/) and [video related](http://fraserxu.me/2013/03/05/7--video-integration-with-jekyll/).

##Some stats maybe

Learning more about data science, look no further but [here](http://www.coppelia.io/2015/09/a-decision-process-for-selecting-statistical-techniques/).
And [also about time and space mapping](https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/time-maps-visualizing-discrete-events-across-many-timescales).


I have recently seen an interesting webminar about [deep learning](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/post/129654767848/fast-forward-labs-interviews-clarifai-about-deep). Two projects discusssed have been [Pictograph](http://www.pictograph.us/#/) and [Clarifai](http://clarifai.com/).
