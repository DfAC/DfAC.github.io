####Who am I?

I am geospatial expert by training currently transitioning into the world of data science. Within last 13 years I have worked various [academic](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lukasz_Bonenberg) and civil engineering industry problems, including [improvement to GPS precise positioning](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/264858490_Closely-coupled_Integration_of_Locata_and_GPS_for_Engineering_Applications). I currently work at the University of Nottingham.

####Why data science?

Because its a blend of programming, statistics, industry specific knowledge, mixed by the lateral thinking and sparkled with the curiosity of the mind. In short, its exciting. And I am not the only one thinking this way. Just google around for terms like "sexiest job of 21st century"  or "data is new oil". 
Lin gave much coherent description on [her blog](http://linbug.github.io/about/), if you want one.
