I trully enjoy markdown, I find it more convenient than Latex for quick write up. I have recently started to experiment with citations [following this introduction](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).

```
cd your-repo-dir\
java -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 30M
```

Some [dont like markdown](http://www.adamhyde.net/whats-wrong-with-markdown/).

## getting it all ready for Tensorflow

I have recently start to work with tensorflow on my windows machine. 

### Installation

I choosen to use docker. There are a number of problems, [mine was AVIRA](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=67840&start=195) the moment I removed it it all worked fine.
