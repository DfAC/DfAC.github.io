I trully enjoy markdown, I find it more convenient than Latex for quick write up. I have recently started to experiment with citations [following this introduction](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).

```
cd your-repo-dir\
java -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 30M
```
