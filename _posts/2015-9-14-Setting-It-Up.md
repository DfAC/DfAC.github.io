So far Jekyll is a wonderful experience. I have just been through [Joshua Lande's post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) showing how to set up few extra things on the blog.
For now this only includes twitter and comments, but I hope this is a taste of things to come. Most likely after reading [this blog](http://jim-y.me/2014/12/23/easy-blogging-with-jekyll-and-github/).
