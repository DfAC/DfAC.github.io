First week of this month I had a pleasure of attending [Fundamentals Of Practical Deep Learning](http://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-London/events/227511203/) - a two days course organise by [Deep Learning London](http://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-London/).

My reason for attending was simple - I wanted to learn more about deep learning and ideally use it in a small project to start with.  I have attended the few meetups demonstrating and discussing deep learning and felt a need for more substantial effort to understand it. This workshop looks ideal - two days of theory and a practice covering most popular frameworks - Caffe, Thorch and Theano.


## Was it worth it

I belive that this course gave a lot for the price I paid. Over the scope of two days I had learned a lot. I haven't worked on the [Google Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) but this is quite new kid in the block, and I do need to understand theoretical aspect before diving in.

I met a lot of people at the different level of Deep Learning	Experience - from experts to starters like me. We ahd a truly geographical spread - participants came not only from UK but worldwide - Finand, Russia, Israel and Singapure.


Before I came on the course I had been discussing use of HPC computing at the University of Nottingham. Participants with the course gave me a good contacts and nVidia so I could discuss GPU needs directly with them. I expect to work on this a bit more over coming month - my goal is to run small Neutral Network project by end of March and try to run it on cluster before end of April. Lets see how it goes.
