## getting it all ready for Tensorflow

I have recently start to work with tensorflow on my windows machine. 

### Installation

I choosen to use docker. There are a number of problems, [mine was AVIRA](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=67840&start=195) the moment I removed it it all worked fine.
