#### Who am I?

I am geospatial expert by training currently transitioning into the world of data science. Within last 13 years I have worked on number of civil engineering industry problems including geodesy, precise positioning and GIS. Six years ago I transited back into [academia](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lukasz_Bonenberg). 

I have completed my PhD at [the University of Nottingham](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/) [combining GPS with similar but terrestrial based positioning system to create precise (cm to dm level) positioning in areas of limited sky visibility](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/264858490_Closely-coupled_Integration_of_Locata_and_GPS_for_Engineering_Applications). Technology I used was created by [Australian start-up](http://www.locata.com/technology/locata-tech-explained/how-is-locata-like-gps/) leading to my interest into disruptive technology, start-ups and data science. I think the first victim was Matlab - I ditched it for python and R.

I currently work at the University of Nottingham.

#### So why [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)?

Because its a blend of programming, statistics, industry specific knowledge, mixed by the lateral thinking and sparkled with the curiosity of the mind. In short, its exciting. And I am not the only one thinking this way. 

How does it relate to my interest described above? Data science is multi disciplinary, relaying on industry-related knowledge, yet in the same time it is highly disruptive. Just see how many [Ycombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) startups has data science at heart.
Data science is not a magical black box. There is a lot of research, knowledge and hard work backing it up to make it successfully.
