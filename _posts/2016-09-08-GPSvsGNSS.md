In my previous post post I have used both term GPS (describing the [American Navigation System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System)) and GNSS. The last terms is an popular umbrella term for all navigation systems including American, Russian, Chinese, European, Japanese and Indian ones.
I have recently read [great GNSS book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00CS398T6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Len Jacobson's where he points out that this is not consistent with original definitions

**GNSS** term has been originally defined by International Civil Aviation Organization ([ICAO](http://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx))  as *"A worldwide position and time determination system that includes one or more satellite constellations, aircraft receivers and system integrity monitoring, augmented as necessary to support the required navigation performance for the intended operation."*. This includes not only augmentation constellation (EGNOS, WAAS and MSAS) but also ground based safety of life infrastructure - much larger definition that we tend to use. Interestingly both the [2007](http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/icg/2007/icg2/presentations/38.pdf) and [2012](http://www.icao.int/Meetings/anconf12/Documents/Doc.%209849.pdf) ICAO documents list only GPS and GLONASS as part of GNSS. This is mostly to the fact that only L1 and G1 are protected frequencies world wide. Galileo E1 should be soon accredited and protected as well.

This would indicate that we should properly say: *GNSS, excluding ground components and Chinese Beiduo and Indian IRNSS*? Nobody is expected to do so now - its interesting case when professional magazines seems to highjack the term.

BTW, as might be aware I will be presenting at [ION GNSS+ 2016 in Portland, Oregon](http://dfac.github.io/blog/2016/08/31/welcome2ION/) next week. If anybody is interesing in learning more get in touch.

I am currently flying and enjoying my new office:)
